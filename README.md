# Mars App - Billie Coding Challenge

## Requirements

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installation

    npm i

## Configuration

Copy environment variables

    cp .env.example .env

## Use

Start the backend server

    npm run server

Start the app on a different console

    npm start

## Comments

    The app was created with create-react-app. I'm using json-server as a backend so two consoles are necessary in order to use the app properly, one for the react app and another one for the json-server.
